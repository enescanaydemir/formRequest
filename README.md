# formRequest
This GitHub repository showcases a form request project developed with JavaScript for the frontend and PHP CodeIgniter for the backend. It includes a dynamic user interface with Bootstrap and jQuery, enabling users to submit and process data on the server. 

Hello! My name is [Your Name], and this GitHub repository has been created for a project I developed using JavaScript on the frontend and PHP CodeIgniter on the backend.

The aim of this project is to create a form request using popular technologies in modern web application development.

On the frontend, I provided a dynamic and interactive user interface using JavaScript. I aimed to create a user-friendly and responsive design by utilizing libraries such as Bootstrap and jQuery. Users can fill out this form to send and process data on the server.

On the backend, I chose PHP CodeIgniter framework. CodeIgniter facilitates the development process by following the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern and offers a performant structure. Form data is processed with PHP on the server and saved in the database, providing feedback to the user when necessary.


This GitHub repository has been created to share the project source code and development process.
